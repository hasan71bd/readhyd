# - map attributes to common names (keys)
# - check if scan() is considerably faster than read.table() with colClasses
#   if so, update read.xxx() functions
# - also track successful time formats
# - verwendete assertthat Funktionen selectiv importieren
# - read.gkd doesn't export all columns
# - standardize colnames (discharge, flow, value) if there are none in header
# - just keep Austrian files, which are unique formats
# - read.hzb() should return attributs solely as a list
# - every function should accept an argument as.zoo = TRUE or similar.
#   or maybe write a function for conversion?
